# React Native Workshop - ReactJSAcademy

## Setup

```
git clone <REPO>
cd react-native-workshop
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

## Run your project

There are Two major ways to run yout Expo projects locally: using EXP, or running it in your Simulator (Xcode or Android Studio, Genymotion...). I recommend installing exp in your cli and login into your account in order to run your project directly into your phone.

### Using EXP

- `npm install exp --global`. You can also install de desktop app (https://github.com/expo/xde)
- `exp login` to login with your account (signup into expo.io required)
- install the Expo client in your phone (and login)
- in the repo directory: `exp start --lan`

This will start the Bundler for the app and enables the app for visualization at your phone. Now you only need to go to your phone to the `Projects` tab and Voila!, there it is!!

Happy Coding!
